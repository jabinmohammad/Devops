MAVEN:
its a build too1.
main file is POM.XML (project object model & Extensible markup language)
POM.XML will have entire information of project.
it is used to create artifact (war, jar, ear)
It is mostly used for java-based projects.
It was initially released on 13 July 2004.
Maven is written in java (1.8.0)

RAW: .java  (we cant use it)
.java -- > compile -- > .class -- > .jar -- > package -- > .war

.class 	: which can be executable
.jar    : group of .class files (works for backend)
.war	: it has frontend and backend code (FE: HTML, CSS, JS & BE: JAVA)
libs	: its a pre defined packages used for code.

ARTIFACTS: its the final product.
JAR = JAVA ARCHIVE
WAR = WEB ARCHIVE 
EAR = ENTERPRISE ARCHIVE

ARCHITECTURE:

SETUP: CREATE EC2
yum install git java-1.8.0-openjdk maven tree -y
git clone https://github.com/devopsbyraham/jenkins-java-project.git
cd jenkins-java-project.git

PLUGIN: its a small software which automates our work.
with the plugins we can use tools without installing them.

GOAL: its a command used to perfrom task.
MAVEN follows a lifecycle

mvn compile	: to compile the source code
mvn test	: to test the code
mvn package	: to create artifact (project directory)
mvn install	: to create artifact (maven home dir .m2)
mvn clean packge: to perform entire goals 
mvn clean	: to delete target


maven			ant
pom.xml			build.xml
life cycle		no life cycle
procedural		declareative
plugins			no plugins
no scripts 		scripts

WHAT IF BUILD FAILS:
1. CHECK JAVA VERSION FOR MAVEN
2. CHECK POM.XML
3. CHECK THE CODE
